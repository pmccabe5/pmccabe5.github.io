## Exercise 2.1

1. A system to control the antilock brake in a car

* Incrimental development: the system will want to use the incrimental development since the system will have multiple iterations and will need to be calibrated over the years of the product cycle

2. A virtual reality system to support software maintenance

* Waterfall: the waterfall method would be best suited since the product is being developed from the ground up and there will be an end of life period for the product as technology changes

3. A university accounting system that replaces an existing system

* Integration and configuration: this methodology would be best suited because there is a product in place that will need to be scaled and migrated to the new platform

4. An interactive healthcare system that helps users plan journeyswith the lowest environmental impact

* Incrimental development: Incrimental would be best suited since security must be built in from the ground up with handling health data. Also, the features need to be up to the client's standards before being incorporated into the final product.
