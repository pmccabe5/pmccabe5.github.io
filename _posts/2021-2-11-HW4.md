< ### Bug Report
< 
< Bug: Button Sensitivty
< 
< - **Description**: The undo/redo buttons are very sensitive when pressed in the GUI window
< - **Environment**: `VMWare ESXi`, `Ubuntu 18.04 Focal Fossa`, `Fedora 32`
< - **Resolution**: It appears that on line 667 of `pippy_app.py` the following code is present, where there is a typo on the variable `butston` which should be `button`.:
< 
< ```
< def __undobutton_cb(self, butston):
<         text_buffer = self._source_tabs.get_text_buffer()
<         if text_buffer.can_undo():
<             text_buffer.undo()
< ```
