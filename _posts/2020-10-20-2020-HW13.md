Risks of moving desktop apps to remote

1. There could be issues with the default configurations for the desktop apps once they move to remote. There would need to be a benchmark set so that the virtual environment is the same as the local desktop environment.

2. Another issue that occurs once the desktop applications move remote is the multi-tenacy of the users, since the environments need to be as close as possible to the local environment. From work experience, virtualization through a third party client that is able to page or call the application and use remote resources to allow the user to temporarily run the app.

3. One of the final problems with moving to a remote model for local desktop applications is the ability to scale as a company either grows or shrinks. Some tools that can be used are a combination of Docker, Kubernetes or Redhat Openshift, and a automation tool such as Ansible or Puppet. These tools can make scaling to fit the needs of the company at any given time.
