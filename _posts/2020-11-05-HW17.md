## Team Progress

This project has been a very interesting roller coaster, but is trending in the right direction. We started out trying to run the `sugar-labs` desktop environment to testing the `calculate-activity`. The progress on the testing framework has run smoothly, with very few hiccups along the way. We look to have completed test cases within the next week or so.
