### Bug Report

Bug: Button Sensitivty

- **Description**: The undo/redo buttons are very sensitive when pressed in the GUI window
- **Environment**: `VMWare ESXi`, `Ubuntu 18.04 Focal Fossa`, `Fedora 32`
- **Resolution**: It appears that on line 667 of `pippy_app.py` the following code is present, where there is a typo on the variable `butston` which should be `button`.:

```
def __undobutton_cb(self, butston):
        text_buffer = self._source_tabs.get_text_buffer()
        if text_buffer.can_undo():
            text_buffer.undo()
```
