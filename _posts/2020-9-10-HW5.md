## 4.5: Using the technique suggested here, where natural language descriptions are presented in a standard format, write plausible user requirements for the following functions:

* An unattended gas pump system that includes a credit card reader. The customer swipes
the card through the reader, then specifies the amount of fuel required. The fuel is
delivered and the customer's account debited.
* The cash-dispensing function in a bank ATM.
* In an internet banking system, a facility that allows customers to transfer funds from one
account held with the bank to another account with the same bank.

### Gas Pump

**1.1** The system will be able to dispense gas

**1.2** The system will be able to accept payments from credit and debit cards

**1.3** The system will be able to accept a pin for a payment

**1.4** The system will be able to select the fuel grade that the user selects

**1.5** The system will be able to dispense fuel

**1.6** The system will be able to calculate the price of the fuel in real time based on the amount dispensed

**1.7** The system will detect if the fuel tank is full

**1.8** The system will charge the card that was accepted at requirement 1.3

**1.9** The system will be able to return a receipt for the transaction if the user asks for it

### Bank ATM

**2.1** The ATM will accept a card

**2.2** The ATM will able to accept a pin as authentication

**2.3** The ATM will not allow cash to be withdrawn if the pint that was entered is wrong

**2.4** The ATM will provide "quick cash" options for dispersement ($20, $40, $60, $80, $100)

**2.5** The ATM will accept a custom amount to be dispersed

**2.6** The ATM will check to make sure that there are suffiecient funds before dispersing money

**2.7** The ATM will disperse the amount specified

**2.8** The ATM will ensure that the transaction is done

**2.9** The ATM will return the card

### Internet Banking

**3.1** The system will be accept a login for authentication

**3.2** The system will ensure the user's number is legal and not an illegal value

**3.3** The system will check the database of accounts to make sure the second account exists

**3.4** The system will accept an amount to be transfered

**3.5** The system will ensure there funds available to transfer

**3.6** The system will be able to securely transfer funds 

**3.7** The system will ask if the user is done

**3.8** The system will log out once done

## 4.6 Suggest how an engineer responsible for drawing up a system requirements specification might keep track of the relationships between functional and non-functional requirements.

A way that an engineer can draw up system requirements is to create a list of the requirements that are asked of by the client themselves. Anything that the engineer would see as worth including in the final package as well as features that would be an add on or improvement to the product that the client would welcome to the application.

## Using your knowledge of how an ATM is used, develop a set of use cases that could serve as a basis for understanding the requirements for an ATM system.

**UC1:** The user will be able to withdraw money from the ATM

**UC2:** The user will be able to deposit money

**UC3:** The user will be able to accept user input for a pin authentication and amount of money tp be tendered

**UC4:** The user will be able to view their current bank information

## Readings Reflection

After reading the provided readings about secure car systems, it only provides further evidence for the current development and legal environment we face: the asymmetric advantage of red hat hackers is years ahead of governments. The overall sentiment is that with simple testing, Software Defined Radio (SDR) tools with injection are only a few hundred dollars, the development team would have had a better grasp on the technology that they were using.With the ever evolving technology, laws for the systems and protocols are lagging behind and proactivity on the legal side of the matter is paramount. The law that prevents the SDR exploit to be patched upon assembly took 5 years to be introduced to congress, way too late to patch and also would incur a financial loss for all car manufaturers with cars with the exploit, since new systems would need to be installed or money for software patches would need to be spent. Thus, the need for a specific Cyber Security comittee in congress, and a government agency for oversight, needs to be created to proactively defend and research security flaws in the real world.
